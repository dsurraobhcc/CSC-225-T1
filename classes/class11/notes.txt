Steps to build and deploy a web app in Django:

1. installed heroku and git locally
2. added a polls app from the django tutorial
3. pushed code changes to heroku
4. ran migrations of data models locally and in heroku (question, choice)

5. heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
6. created a second user from the admin console

Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
make code changes locally
git push heroku main
updates the website

Database: 
locally: using SQLite3
heroku: using Postgres
Advantage of models: ORM (object-relational mapper)
